### Data Analysis Section

We analyzed risk of suicide attempt in the 4 year follow up scenarium in the study population, considering as predictores the presence of anxiety, current anxiety diagnostic and anxiety symptoms at baseline assessment. Also, all analysis were performed for MDD and TAB patients separatly. Outcome variables were suicide attempt (presence of absence) or a suicidality classification (tendency to suicide attempt) defined by previous suicide attempt and/or suicide ideation score higher then 8 [ref].
The survival distribution function estimates for repetition of suicide attempt. A test for homogeneity of survival functions across anxiety and non-anxiety diagnosed patients was completed regarding anxiety by XXXX diagnostic by use of a generalized Wilcoxon test. The effect of factors on survival. The survival curves for suicide attempt or suicidality were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to compare the groups. Associations between anxiety symptoms and survival rates was analysed using Cox’s proportional hazards model. The 95% confidence intervals for the hazard ratio were estimated based on the Wald test. 

Survival analysis were conducted using R Language software through the survival packages [ref]. The procedure yields an estimate of the hazard ratio and a test for the significance of the estimate. Hazard ratio can be interpreted as relative risk. In this study, factors that may change value during the follow-up period are analysed as time-dependence covariates [10].Individuals were removed from the study if they died or immigrated during the follow-up period.


### Results Section

By the end of the 12-year follow-up 22% (50 out of 224) had died: 31% of male (n = 31) and 15% of female (n = 19) suicide attempters (Fisher's exact test p = 0.006) (Table 1). Seventeen (8%) of the patients had committed suicide: 9 (9%) of the males and 8 (6%) of the females.

Suicide accounted for 34% of all deaths. There were no statistically significant differences in suicide rates or over- all mortality between the four Finnish centres. 41% (N = 7) of the subjects completing suicide switched the suicide method to another. 21 attempters (9%; 11 males and 10 females) had died by natural causes, 11 (5%; 10 males and 1 female) had died by accidents and one male was murdered.

The cumulative survival curve plots for the 12-year follow- up appear in Figures 1 and 2 for each gender. The overall risk of death among males was significantly higher (log rank statistics 8.06, df = 1, p = 0.0045) (Figure 1). There was no statistically significant gender difference in suicide risk during the follow-up period (log rank statistics 0.75, df = 1, p = 0.4) (Figure 2).

Suicide attempters who eventually committed suicide had scored higher on Beck's Suicidal Intention Scale (Table 1). Reasons and motives for the suicide attempt appear in Table 2. Problems with partner, having wanted to die, and having wanted to make things easier for others were more common among those who committed suicide. Physical illness or disability and problems with partner were more common among suicide attempters who died (all causes) during the follow-up. High scores on Beck's Suicidal Intention Scale predicted suicide (Table 3). Male gender, older age, physical illness or disability and high scores on Beck's Suicidal Intention Scale predicted death (all causes) (Table 3).

The estimate of the function of the distribution of repetition, suicide and death for attempters and non-attempters is displayed in Figure 1. The probability of attempters repeating the suicide attempt within 2000 days (5.5 years) is approximately 37.34%. The probability of attempters repeating the suicide attempt is strongest immediately after the first registered suicide attempt, but afterapproximately2yearsitisreducedandremainsconstantfor the rest of the follow-up period.
Theprobabilityofdeathbysuicidewithin1750days(4.75 years)isapproximately60timesstrongerforattemptersthannon- attempters, and the probability of death within 2000 days (5.5 years) is approximately four times stronger for attempters than non-attempters. When excluding suicides from the analysis, attempters are approximately three times more likely to die than are non-attempters within the follow-up period. Suicide is also more likely to occur shortly after the suicide attempt, which places the period immediately after the index attempt as the highest risk period for repetition and suicide. Death occurs more constantly across the follow-up period for attempters than for non-attempters.

The most recent 5-year, 10-year, 15-year, and 20-year period estimates of relative survival rates for all invasive cancers combined (all races, both sexes) were about 1%, 7%, 11%, and 11%, respectively, higher than those calculated by cohort-based analysis (table 2). Cohort estimates of long-term survival rates were much lower for men than for women, whereas period estimates for both sexes were closely similar.
One of the reasons why survival rates have in the past been so much lower for men than for women is because of the large proportion of lung cancers (which have a very poor prognosis) in men with cancer. After exclusion of patients with lung and bronchus cancer, survival estimates were higher than those for all invasive cancers (especially for men), differences between survival estimates for men and women diminished, and differences between period and cohort estimates became even larger (table 2).
The figure shows the most recent cohort and period relative survival curves for all invasive cancers, apart from lung and bronchus cancer (all races, both sexes). Cohorts of patients diagnosed many years ago had much lower survival rates throughout follow-up than those diagnosed
