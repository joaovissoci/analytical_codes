#Using gather and spread in dplyr

#Gather is used to "gather" a set a variables into a vector. As if you
#are stacking them up. It gets a set a variables and stackes them into
#a vactor caller key (you can change the name) and the actual value
#into another vector called value (you can change it too).
#You can also list a set of variables to be maintend constant with the
#-var notation.

#simples example


#complex example

injury_level_data<-study_data %>%

				  gather(key, value, -c("age",
										  "gender",
										  "education_recoded",
										  "occupation_recoded",
										  "race",
										  "year_visits",
										  "monthly_income",
										  "insurance",
										  "record_id"))

#Spread is the oposite. It gets a stacked vector and flashes it out into
#corresponding vectors. Unstackes the variable.
